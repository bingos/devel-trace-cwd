=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -d:Trace::Cwd program

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you run your program with C<perl -d:Trace::Cwd program>, this module
will print a message to standard error just before each line is executed.  
For example, if your program looks like this:

        #!/usr/bin/perl
        
        
        print "Statement 1 at line 4\n";
        print "Statement 2 at line 5\n";
        print "Call to sub x returns ", &x(), " at line 6.\n";
        
        exit 0;
        
        
        sub x {
          print "In sub x at line 12.\n";
          return 13;
        }

Then  the C<Trace> output will look like this:

        >> ./test:4: print "Statement 1 at line 4\n";
        >> ./test:5: print "Statement 2 at line 5\n";
        >> ./test:6: print "Call to sub x returns ", &x(), " at line 6.\n";
        >> ./test:12:   print "In sub x at line 12.\n";
        >> ./test:13:   return 13;
        >> ./test:8: exit 0;

This is something like the shell's C<-x> option.

If the current working directory changes during execution that will be printed to standard error
with a C<CWD:> prefix.

=head1 DETAILS

Inside your program, you can enable and disable tracing by doing

    $Devel::Trace::Cwd::TRACE = 1;   # Enable
    $Devel::Trace::Cwd::TRACE = 0;   # Disable

or

    Devel::Trace::Cwd::trace('on');  # Enable
    Devel::Trace::Cwd::trace('off'); # Disable

=over 

=item C<trace>

C<Devel::Trace> exports the C<trace> function if you ask it to:

    import Devel::Trace::Cwd 'trace';

Then if you want you just say

    trace 'on';                 # Enable
    trace 'off';                # Disable

=back

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

You should be able to  send the trace output to the filehandle of your choice.

=item *

You should be able to specify the format of the output.

=item *

You should be able to get the output into a string.

=back

We'll see.
